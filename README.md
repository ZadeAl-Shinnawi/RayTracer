This is a personal project where I will be implementing a ray tracer from scratch in C++ to learn more about the features, algorithms, and implementations of modern ray tracers. All image properties and details are output into a .PPM file.

Current features list:

1. MSAA

Future features list:

1. Diffuse Materials
2. Metal
3. Glass
4. ...
