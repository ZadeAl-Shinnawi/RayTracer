Example render from my ray tracer.

This is a personal project where I will be implementing a ray tracer from scratch in C++ to learn more about the features, algorithms, and implementations of modern ray tracers. All image properties and details are output into a .PPM file.

Current features list:

1. MSAA
2. Diffuse material
3. Metal material
4. Glass material
5. Positionable camera
6. Motion Blur
